"""Build the reduced draft vocabulary for files/patch_mtp_draft_vocab.py.

Counts token frequencies over a corpus and writes the most frequent ids, one
per line. The corpus that matters is the *model's own output distribution*,
because that is what the drafter has to predict -- not a general text corpus
and not the prompts.

  python3 files/build_draft_vocab.py corpus.jsonl --out draft_vocab.txt --size 32768

Reads .jsonl with a "text" field, or plain .txt. Always keeps every special /
added token AND every byte-level token, whatever their frequency: those are
cheap (a few hundred rows) and losing one costs acceptance at exactly the
structural boundaries where drafts are otherwise easiest. Byte-level tokens
matter most for non-English text -- they are what BPE falls back to for
multi-byte UTF-8 -- and frequency alone will not keep them on a small corpus.

Coverage, not size, is the number to tune on. Report prints the fraction of
corpus token occurrences the chosen vocabulary covers; the tokens it misses
are not errors, they are drafts the target model will reject.

    # Byte-level tokens are pinned for the same reason as special tokens, and

    # the merges do not cover, which on this tokenizer means every multi-byte
    # UTF-8 sequence -- accented Latin, CJK, emoji. They are ~256 rows, so
    # keeping them is free.
    #
    # Frequency alone does NOT keep them. A corpus large and varied enough
    # exercises them often enough to rank; a smaller or narrower one does not,
    # and then they are silently dropped. Measured on this checkpoint: a build
    # over 513 MiB of wikitext keeps 376 ids below 400, while one over 11.7 MB
    # of conversation logs keeps 286 -- 90 fewer, and the missing ones are what
    # assemble "n-tilde" and the accents. The resulting drafter proposes badly
    # at exactly those boundaries.
    #
    # The scan assumes the first 512 ids hold the byte-level alphabet and
    # nothing else, which is a property of GPT-2-style byte-level BPE, not a
    # general rule that single-character tokens are byte-level. Measured on this
    # tokenizer: the predicate pins exactly 256 ids, contiguous over 0-255, all
    # of them through `len(piece) == 1` and none through `<0x..>` -- Qwen maps
    # each byte to one printable character ("!" .. "N-acute"), so the whole
    # alphabet sits there and no other single-character token appears above it.
    # The `<0x..>` branch is for SentencePiece-style byte fallback, which this
    # tokenizer does not use; it costs nothing and covers that family. On a
    # future tokenizer that puts an ordinary single-character token inside the
    # first 512 ids, the predicate would pin it too -- harmless, one row, but
    # worth knowing before widening the window.
